  about: {
    bio: "An engineer, researcher, and founder working at the intersection of AI and biology. I build deep learning systems that decode cellular complexity and turn them into insights for precision medicine. As the founder of DeepOMAP, I'm developing AI-driven platforms to transform single-cell data into actionable discoveries for leukemia research, while also leading GAME LLC, a sports-tech startup empowering athletes through intelligent onboarding and matchmaking. My work bridges computational biology, scalable systems, and human-centered design ‚Äî driven by a single mission: to make complex science and technology both explainable and impactful.",
    extendedBio: "Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working with diverse teams and tackling complex challenges across various industries. From healthcare AI platforms to e-commerce solutions, I've learned that great software comes from understanding both the technical requirements and the human needs behind every project.\n\nWhen I'm not coding, you'll find me contributing to open-source projects, exploring new technologies, or sharing knowledge with the developer community. I believe in continuous learning and staying curious about emerging trends in web development.",
